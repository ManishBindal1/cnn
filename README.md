## General Information
- This is a programming assignment part of a course. 
- In this assignment, you will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow to detect melanoma. 
- Identify the effects of data augmentation strategy and rectifying class imbalance.

## Conclusions
1. With simple model without data augmentation and with class imbalance, model was underfit. 
2. With data augmentation, model performance become better. 
3. Class rebalance helps with the model performance.
4. There is no overfitting observed with the latest model.
5. Infact validation accuracy is better than training accuracy.
6. Performance of the model can be made better though.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow
